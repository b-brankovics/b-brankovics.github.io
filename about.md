# About me

I am a bioinformatician currently working at Westerdijk Fungal
Biodiversity Institute (former CBS-KNAW). Currently working on my PhD.

I completed my Bachelor and Master studies as a Biologist at the
University of Szeged (Szeged, Hungary).

When I submitted my Bachelor thesis, I migrated from Windows to Ubuntu
on my home computer. As a Linux user I started learning a bit of shell
programming which did not exceed the bare essentials for maintaining
my OS installation. During my Master studies Edx was launched and
I took up the first course on Python, _Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python (MITx - 6.00.1x)_. This course taught me the basics
of programming. After this course I started experimenting with some of the
sequence data that I have generated during my internship or data I downloaded.
The next major step that helped my become a bioinformatician was when I read
_Learning Perl_ by Randal L. Schwartz, brian d foy, Tom Phoenix
(O'Reilly Media). Learning Perl is probably the most important for becoming
a bioinformatician, it was the programming language used during the first
genome project.
