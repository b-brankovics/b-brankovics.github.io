## Selective assembly of genomic regions
Assembling only a selective part of the genomic or transcriptomic
data makes the analysis computationally less demanding.
This has multiple advantages: i)&nbsp;less time is required for the
analysis, ii)&nbsp;even less powerful computers can handle the analysis
and iii)&nbsp;less or no unnecessary sequence information is generated
besides the region that you are interested in, so you don't have to
sift through the whole genome to find the gene or region that you
need.
